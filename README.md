# Lab01
FIR Laboratory
In the standard_FIR repository there are all files related to the standard implementation of a FIR filter.
  In SRC directory there are the .vhdl files; in TB directory there are the files related to the testbench.
  In the zipped one there are all the files related to matlab, c, synopsys, innovus, that can be usefull for the comprehension of the project.


In the unfolded_FIR repository there are all files related to the unfolded and pipelined implementation of a FIR filter.
  In SRC directory there are the .vhdl files; in TB directory there are the files related to the testbench.
  In the zipped one there are all the files related to matlab, c, synopsys, innovus, that can be usefull for the comprehension of the project.


Due to the GitHub's limit of space, all other files, including report for power, timing and area, are located in the zipped directories in SYN folders for both the type of filters.

# Lab02
Digital Arithmetic

In SRC directory there are the .vhdl files; in TB directory there are the files related to the testbench. In the zipped one there are all the files related to synopsys, modelsim, that can be usefull for the comprehension of the project.

Src_standard is the normal implementation as downloaded by Portale della Didattica; src_pipelined_input is the implementation with a chain of registers at the input; src_pipelined_input_output is the implementation with a chain of registers at the input and the output; src_mbe is the implementation with a chain of registers at the input and the MBE. The testbench is equal for all implementations.

Due to the GitHub's limit of space, all other files, including report for power, timing and area, are located in the zipped directories in SYN folders.

# Lab03
RISC V LITE

In SRC directory there are the .vhdl files; in TB directory there are the files related to the testbench.
Src_std is the standard implementation of RISC V LITE. Src_abs is the implementation using the absolute value unit.
